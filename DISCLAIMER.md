## ⚠️ Safety Warning

This open-source project is **not a certified medical device**. **Incorrect assembly, wiring, or electrode setup can cause dangerous current delivery**, leading to **skin burns/lesions**, unintended stimulation effects, equipment failure, or electric shock. tDCS/tES should only be performed with **medical-grade, certified equipment** and appropriate screening/supervision—**do not use DIY devices or unvalidated protocols on a person**.

## Terms

This project is for research and education only. By using, building, or modifying this project, you agree to the following:

- **No medical use**: Not approved for diagnosis or treatment. Do not use to self-treat any condition.
- **Your risk**: You assume all risks, including injury, discomfort, data loss, or property damage.
- **No warranty**: Provided "as is," without warranties or guarantees of safety, performance, or fitness.
- **No liability**: Contributors and maintainers are not liable for any direct or indirect damages.
- **Local laws**: You are responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations.
- **Health/implants**: Do not use if you have medical implants, epilepsy, skin lesions at electrode sites, or other contraindications. Consult a qualified clinician before any human use.
- **Supervision**: Do not use alone. Do not use on minors. Keep away from water and flammable environments.
- **Operation**: Verify electrode contact and polarity. Stop immediately on discomfort, pain, or adverse effects.
- **Power**: Use suitable batteries only. Inspect wiring. Avoid short circuits and overheating.
- **Research ethics**: If used with human subjects, follow institutional and ethical guidelines and obtain informed consent.

**If you do not accept these terms, do not use this project.**
